# Dad Jokes App

🎉 Welcome to Dad Jokes, your ultimate source of laughter! Our app is meticulously crafted with modern Android development principles to deliver a seamless and delightful user experience.

## Features

🏗️ **Multimodule Architecture**: Our app is structured with a multimodule architecture, dividing functionalities into separate modules such as analytics, ads, framework, and core functionalities. This approach ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, facilitating easier development and updates.

🔍 **Clean Architecture**: With Clean Architecture at the core, we maintain a clear separation of concerns, enabling scalability and flexibility in our codebase. This architecture promotes testability, maintainability, and a high level of abstraction, ensuring robustness and ease of future enhancements.

🖼️ **MVVM and MVI**: We employ a combination of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and MVI (Model-View-Intent) patterns in our app's presentation layer. This architectural choice allows for a clear separation of concerns, making our UI logic more organized, testable, and easier to maintain.

🔥 **Firebase Integration**: Harnessing the power of Firebase, we seamlessly integrate various services such as Remote Config, Performance SDK, Analytics, Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage. These services enhance user experience, track app performance, and provide real-time insights for continuous improvement.

💰 **Google AdMob Ads**: Our app features native interstitial and app open ads seamlessly integrated using Google AdMob. These ads are strategically placed to ensure a non-intrusive advertising experience while generating revenue to support our app's development and maintenance.

🤣 **Open Source API**: We leverage the open-source API [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) to fetch hilarious dad jokes for our users. This API integration adds a fun and entertaining element to our app, keeping users engaged and coming back for more laughs.
